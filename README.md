# The Child monitor system
This is a project that uses RPI's IR camera, usb mic, near field magnetic detector and long-range ultrasonic sensor with aim to find, recognize and track a child in back seat in the car. When the car is stopped and driver/adults abandoned the child then the system should recognize the event and send alarm messages to predefined destination. Currently under develop.
