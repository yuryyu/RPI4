# The Child monitor system
This is a project that uses RPI IR camera, near field magnetic detector and multiple long-range ultrasonic sensors to find, recognize  and track
a child in back seat in the car. If car is stopped and driver/adults abandoned the child than the system should recognize the event and send alarm messages to different destination. Currently under develop.
